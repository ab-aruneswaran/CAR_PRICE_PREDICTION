# Car_Price_Prediction

<p align="justify">
Program Explanation: This is a program to predict car prices based on the features of the available dataset.
The idea is to predict car prices using processed data and form models using the Decision Tree Regression method for several different features resulting from feature selection, then evaluate the model and choose the best model.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

### Getting Started
1. You can access the raw data [here](https://github.com/ab-aruneswaran/Car_Price_Prediction/blob/main/dataset/CarPred.csv) within this repo.
2. All of the scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/ab-aruneswaran/Car_Price_Prediction/blob/main/Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb).


### Result 

 This Machine Learning Model achieves a high accuracy of 100% using Decision Tree Regression Algorithms.
#### I hope this will be useful someday, thankyou for seeing !‚úåüèª
